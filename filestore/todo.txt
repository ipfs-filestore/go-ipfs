- Provide means of upgrading filestore

- Don't enable filestore by default
  - Note: Once enabled disabling it will cause problems

- Make some parts of the filestore configurable, for example how
  verification is handled: never, by timestamp, always

- Figure out how to pass absolute path names when the server is
  offline.

- Make sure the filestore commands are safe to run when the node is
  online.  Might need to do some locking.
